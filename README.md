# Graph-Algorithms
Implements a number of graph algorithms

Compile and run:

```
java NetworkAnalysis network_data_file.txt
```

Options are as follows:

1. Find lowest latency path
2. Determine if the graph is copper-only connected
3. Find the maximum amount of data on a path (max flow)
4. Find the lowest average latency spanning tree
5. Determine if it is possible for the graph to become disconnected by removing two vertices
